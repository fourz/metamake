   - Feature documentation generation
   - Step-by-step implementation guides
   - Validation checklists
   - Modular solution structure
   - Documentation integration throughout

3. **Project Configuration**
   - project-details.md as primary interface
   - User-defined project contexts and workflows
   - Web query access capabilities
   - Example templates and design patterns

4. **Folder Structure Support**
