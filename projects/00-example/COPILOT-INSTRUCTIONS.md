# COPILOT-INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Purpose
This document provides instructions for GitHub Copilot when working with this Example Solution Implementation Project. It guides Copilot in generating appropriate content, following project standards, and maintaining the solution-focused approach with integrated documentation.

## Project Context
This is an example project demonstrating the Metamake solution implementation workflow. The project focuses on implementing a basic programming automation solution with comprehensive documentation integrated throughout the development process.

## Content Generation Guidelines

### Feature Documentation
When generating feature documentation:
- Focus on clear requirements and specifications
- Include implementation considerations
- Reference related implementation guides and validation checklists
- Follow the structure in existing feature documentation
- Store in the `/features` directory

### Implementation Guides
When creating implementation guides:
- Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions
- Include code examples with explanations
- Highlight potential issues and solutions
- Cross-reference related features and validation
- Store in the `/implementation` directory

### Validation Checklists
When developing validation checklists:
- Create comprehensive verification steps
- Include both functional and non-functional checks
- Provide clear acceptance criteria
- Reference related features and implementation guides
- Store in the `/validation` directory

### Technical Documentation
When generating technical documentation:
- Focus on system architecture and components
- Include diagrams where appropriate
- Document APIs, interfaces, and data structures
- Provide troubleshooting and maintenance guidance
- Store in the `/docs` directory

## Documentation-as-Code Principles
- Treat documentation as a first-class deliverable
- Maintain documentation alongside code in version control
- Apply the same review and quality standards to documentation as code
- Ensure documentation evolves with the solution implementation
- Update documentation as part of every feature change

## Content Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Follow consistent markdown formatting
- Include appropriate metadata
- Maintain cross-references between related documents
- Follow the naming conventions established in the project

## Workflow Integration
- Generate documentation as part of the solution implementation process
- Update existing documentation when requirements or implementations change
- Ensure validation checklists reflect current requirements
- Maintain consistency across all project documentation

## Example Usage
When asked to implement a new feature, Copilot should:
1. Generate feature documentation first
2. Create implementation guide with detailed steps
3. Develop validation checklist for verification
4. Update technical documentation as needed
5. Ensure all documents cross-reference each other appropriately

By following these instructions, Copilot will maintain the project's focus on solution implementation with integrated documentation throughout the development lifecycle.
