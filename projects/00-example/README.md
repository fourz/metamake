# README: Example Solution Implementation Project

## Project Overview
This example project demonstrates Metamake's solution implementation workflow. It showcases a basic programming automation solution with modular features, implementation guides, and validation checklists.

## Solution Structure

### Features
- [Environment Setup](features/01-environment-setup.md) - Automated environment configuration
- [Variable Management] - Coming soon
- [Control Flow Automation] - Coming soon

### Implementation Guides
- [Setting Up Your Environment](implementation/01-environment-setup-guide.md) - Step-by-step implementation guide

### Validation
- [Environment Setup Checklist](validation/01-environment-setup-checklist.md) - Verification criteria

### Documentation
- [Documentation Integration Guide](docs/documentation-integration-guide.md) - How documentation fits into the workflow

## Getting Started
1. Review the project-details.md file to understand the solution scope and structure
2. Follow the implementation guides in the implementation/ directory
3. Use the validation checklists to verify your implementation
4. Contribute to the documentation in the docs/ directory

## Documentation-as-Code
This project demonstrates documentation-as-code principles:
- Documentation is stored alongside code in version control
- Documentation follows the same review and approval processes
- Changes to features require corresponding documentation updates
- Documentation is treated as a first-class deliverable

## How to Use This Example
- Use this project as a template for new solution implementations
- Follow the folder structure and file naming conventions
- Adapt the documentation approach to your specific needs
- Integrate documentation throughout your development workflow
