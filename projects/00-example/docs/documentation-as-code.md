# Documentation-as-Code Workflow Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how documentation should be treated as code in the Metamake solution implementation workflow. By applying software development practices to documentation, we ensure higher quality, better maintainability, and stronger integration between solution components and their documentation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation Lives with Code
- Documentation files are stored in the same repository as code
- Directory structure organizes documentation alongside related components
- Documentation changes are tracked in version control (Git)

### 2. Documentation Changes Follow Same Workflow as Code
- Create branches for documentation changes
- Submit pull requests for documentation updates
- Conduct reviews of documentation changes
- Merge documentation into main branch using same standards as code

### 3. Documentation is a First-Class Deliverable
- Documentation is part of the definition of "done"
- Features aren't complete until documentation is updated
- Documentation quality is evaluated during reviews
- Documentation has clear ownership and accountability

### 4. Automate Documentation Where Possible
- Use GitHub Copilot to assist in documentation generation
- Leverage templates for consistency
- Extract documentation from code comments where appropriate
- Use validation tools to check documentation quality

## Implementation Workflow

### Feature Documentation
1. Start with feature documentation in `/features` directory
2. Document requirements and specifications
3. Include cross-references to related components
4. Version this documentation alongside feature planning

### Implementation Documentation
1. Create implementation guides in `/implementation` directory
2. Document step-by-step procedures
3. Update as implementation evolves
4. Include code examples and explanations

### Validation Documentation
1. Create validation checklists in `/validation` directory
2. Define test cases and acceptance criteria
3. Update based on implementation changes
4. Document validation results

### Technical Documentation
1. Create comprehensive documentation in `/docs` directory
2. Include architecture diagrams, API references, etc.
3. Update when system changes
4. Ensure it remains in sync with implementation

## Best Practices

### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Write for the target audience
- Include examples and illustrations
- Use consistent terminology

### Markdown Formatting
- Follow a consistent heading structure
- Use proper lists, tables, and code blocks
- Include metadata (authors, dates, version info)
- Apply linting rules for consistency

### Review Process
- Technical accuracy review
- Completeness check
- Clarity and usability review
- Consistency with other documentation

## Tools and Resources
- VS Code with Markdown extensions
- Markdown linters
- Diagramming tools (Mermaid, PlantUML)
- GitHub Copilot for documentation assistance

## Documentation Quality Checklist
- [ ] Is the documentation stored with related code?
- [ ] Does it follow the project's style guidelines?
- [ ] Is it clear and understandable to the target audience?
- [ ] Does it include necessary examples and illustrations?
- [ ] Has it been reviewed for technical accuracy?
- [ ] Is it up-to-date with the current implementation?
- [ ] Does it include proper cross-references?
- [ ] Is it accessible and properly formatted?
