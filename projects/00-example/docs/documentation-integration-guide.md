# Documentation Integration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines how documentation should be integrated into the solution implementation workflow. Documentation is treated as a first-class deliverable, created and maintained alongside code and implementation artifacts.

## Documentation Types

### Feature Documentation
Located in `/features` directory
- **Purpose**: Define requirements and specifications for each solution feature
- **When to Create**: At the beginning of feature planning
- **Who Creates**: Solution architects, product owners, or lead developers
- **Update Cadence**: When requirements change or new capabilities are added

### Implementation Guides
Located in `/implementation` directory
- **Purpose**: Provide step-by-step instructions for implementing features
- **When to Create**: After feature documentation is approved
- **Who Creates**: Technical writers with developer input, or developers
- **Update Cadence**: When implementation methods change or issues are discovered

### Validation Checklists
Located in `/validation` directory
- **Purpose**: Ensure implementations meet requirements and quality standards
- **When to Create**: After implementation guide is complete
- **Who Creates**: QA engineers or developers
- **Update Cadence**: When requirements change or new validation steps are needed

### Technical Documentation
Located in `/docs` directory
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive understanding of solution components
- **Types**:
  - Architecture overviews
  - API documentation
  - System diagrams
  - Troubleshooting guides
  - Maintenance procedures
- **When to Create**: Alongside or shortly after implementation
- **Update Cadence**: With any significant system change

## Documentation Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Create initial feature documentation
   - Outline documentation needs for the solution

2. **Development Phase**
   - Write implementation guides
   - Document APIs and interfaces
   - Create architecture diagrams

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Develop validation checklists
   - Document testing procedures
   - Create troubleshooting guides

4. **Release Phase**
   - Finalize all documentation
   - Create maintenance procedures
   - Ensure documentation quality and completeness

## Markdown Formatting Standards
- Use proper heading hierarchy (# for title, ## for major sections, etc.)
- Include blank lines before and after lists and code blocks
- Use code fencing with language specification for code blocks
- Include alt text for all images
- Maintain a consistent voice and terminology

## Documentation Integration Checklist
- [ ] Documentation created or updated with each feature
- [ ] All code includes appropriate comments and documentation
- [ ] Documentation reviewed by subject matter experts
- [ ] Documentation tested for accuracy (steps work as described)
- [ ] Documentation meets accessibility standards
- [ ] Version control maintained for all documentation

## Tools and Resources
- VS Code with Markdown extensions
- Mermaid or PlantUML for diagrams
- Screenshots with annotations as needed
- Documentation templates (see /templates directory)

Remember: Good documentation is not an afterthoughtâ€”it's an integral part of the solution.
