# Metamake Use Cases Guide

This guide outlines the two primary approaches for using Metamake in your development workflow: the Integration Method and the Metamake-as-Root Method. Each approach serves different needs and project structures, allowing you to choose the best fit for your specific situation.

## Overview of Approaches

### Integration Method

Drop Metamake into any existing project to enhance it with structured project management capabilities while preserving your current structure and processes.

### Metamake-at-Root Method

Use Metamake as the primary organizational framework, generating new "projects" within the projects folder for different aspects of your work like iteration planning, design, tooling, and experimentation.

## Approach 1: Integration Method

### Integration Description

The Integration Method allows you to add Metamake's project management capabilities to any existing project without disrupting your current structure. This approach is ideal when you want to enhance an established project with structured documentation and workflow guidance.

### Integration Use Cases

- **Existing Projects**: You have an established codebase or project that you want to enhance
- **Team Adoption**: You want to gradually introduce structured project management to a team
- **Minimal Disruption**: You need to maintain existing workflows while adding new capabilities
- **Legacy Projects**: You're working with established projects that have existing documentation and processes

### Integration Implementation Steps

1. **Add Metamake to Your Project**

   - Copy the entire `metamake/` folder into your project root directory
   - Your project structure becomes:

   ```text
   your-project/
   ├── src/                    # Your existing code
   ├── docs/                   # Your existing docs
   ├── scripts/                # Your existing scripts
   ├── metamake/               # New Metamake integration
   │   ├── README.md
   │   ├── prompts/
   │   ├── projects/
   │   └── template/
   └── .github/
       └── copilot-instructions.md  # Generated integration
   ```

2. **Run Integration Process**

   - Use `metamake/prompts/prompt-metamake-integration.md`
   - Provide context about your project structure and needs
   - Generate customized `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

3. **Maintain Separation**

   - Keep your existing project structure intact
   - Use `metamake/projects/` for new structured project management needs
   - Reference existing documentation and processes in Metamake materials

### Integration Example Scenarios

#### Web Application Enhancement

**Situation**: You have a React/Node.js application with standard structure (`src/`, `docs/`, `package.json`)

**Integration Approach**:

- Add `metamake/` folder to project root
- Generate Copilot instructions that understand React/Node.js patterns
- Use `metamake/projects/` for feature planning, architecture decisions, and process improvements
- Keep existing `src/` and `docs/` structure unchanged

**Benefits**:

- Enhanced project planning without disrupting development workflow
- Structured approach to feature development and technical decisions
- Improved documentation practices alongside existing code documentation

#### Data Science Project Enhancement

**Situation**: You have a Python data science project with notebooks, data files, and analysis scripts

**Integration Approach**:

- Add `metamake/` to project alongside `notebooks/`, `data/`, `models/`
- Create Copilot instructions that understand data science workflows
- Use `metamake/projects/` for experiment planning, analysis documentation, and methodology guides
- Maintain existing notebook and data organization

**Benefits**:

- Systematic approach to experiment design and documentation
- Better tracking of analysis decisions and methodologies
- Structured validation and reproducibility practices

#### DevOps Infrastructure Enhancement

**Situation**: You have infrastructure-as-code with Terraform, deployment scripts, and monitoring configurations

**Integration Approach**:

- Integrate `metamake/` with existing `infrastructure/`, `automation/`, `monitoring/`
- Generate instructions that understand DevOps and infrastructure patterns
- Use `metamake/projects/` for infrastructure planning, deployment strategies, and operational procedures
- Preserve existing infrastructure code organization

**Benefits**:

- Structured approach to infrastructure changes and deployments
- Better documentation of operational procedures and decisions
- Systematic planning for infrastructure evolution and improvements

## Approach 2: Metamake-as-Root Method

### Root Method Description

The Metamake-at-Root Method uses Metamake as the primary organizational framework for your work. Instead of integrating with an existing project, you use Metamake's project structure to organize different aspects of your development work into separate, focused projects.

### Root Method Use Cases

- **New Initiatives**: Starting fresh work or exploration without existing constraints
- **Multiple Concerns**: Need to separate different aspects of work (design, tooling, iteration, etc.)
- **Research and Development**: Exploring new technologies, approaches, or solutions
- **Learning Projects**: Working through training materials or skill development
- **Prototyping**: Building proof-of-concepts or experimental implementations

### Root Method Implementation Steps

1. **Use Metamake as Primary Structure**

   - Clone or download Metamake repository as your main workspace
   - Use `projects/` folder as your primary organization method
   - Each concern becomes a separate project under `projects/`

2. **Create Focused Projects**

   - Use scaffold prompts to generate new projects for different concerns
   - Keep projects separate but related through cross-references
   - Allow each project to evolve independently while maintaining coherence

3. **Maintain Project Separation**

   - Each project has its own complete Metamake structure
   - Projects can reference each other but maintain independence
   - Use consistent naming and organization across projects

### Project Organization Patterns

- Use templates and prompts to ensure structural consistency
- Cross-reference related projects and materials appropriately
- Keep documentation current with actual implementation status

### Project Management

- Use roadmap iteration process regularly regardless of approach
- Maintain clear project objectives and success criteria
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference
- Ensure alignment between different projects or integrated components

### Team Collaboration

- Establish clear guidelines for which approach to use when
- Provide training on both methods for team flexibility
- Use consistent naming conventions and organization patterns
- Maintain shared understanding of project boundaries and relationships

### Quality Assurance

- Apply the same quality standards regardless of approach
- Use validation checklists to ensure completeness
- Regular reviews and updates to maintain accuracy
- Integration testing between related projects or components

## Migration and Evolution

### From Integration to Metamake-as-Root

If you start with integration and want to move to Metamake-as-Root:

1. Identify separable concerns in your integrated project
2. Create new Metamake projects for each distinct concern
3. Migrate relevant documentation and materials
4. Establish cross-references between old and new organization
5. Gradually transition team workflows to new structure

### From Metamake-as-Root to Integration

If you start with separate projects and want to integrate:

1. Identify the primary project that should become the integration target
2. Consolidate related projects into the target project structure
3. Run integration process with consolidated context
4. Migrate relevant materials and maintain necessary separation
5. Update team workflows to use integrated approach

Both approaches are designed to evolve with your needs, and the choice between them can change as your project and team requirements develop over time.
