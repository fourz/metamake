# Metamake Roadmap: Establishing the Golden Initial State

## Vision

Create a robust, well-documented "golden" initial state for Metamake. This will serve as the definitive starting point for building, using, and extending document-based solution implementation workflows in any domain or for any purpose.

## Current Goal

- Finalize the core framework, folder structure, and documentation templates
- Ensure all prompts, instruction files, and example projects are accurate, consistent, and easy to use
- Integrate best practices for documentation-as-code and modular solution development
- Validate that new projects can be scaffolded and extended with minimal friction

## Short-Term Objectives

- Review and refine all core files and templates
- Test the project creation workflow for clarity and reliability
- Document usage patterns and extension strategies for specialized work types
- Provide clear guidance for integrating new domains and workflows

## Medium-Term Objectives

- Gather feedback from initial users and contributors
- Expand example projects to cover more use cases
- Develop additional templates for emerging work types
- Improve automation for scaffolding and documentation generation

## Long-Term Vision

- Continuously evolve the system to support new technologies, workflows, and best practices

This roadmap is focused on delivering a "golden" initial state for Metamake, ensuring it is ready to use and extend for any project, in any context.
