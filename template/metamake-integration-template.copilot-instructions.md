# Copilot Instructions Template for [PROJECT_NAME] with Metamake

> **AI Assistant Guide for [PROJECT_DOMAIN] Organization & Project Management with Metamake Tools**

These instructions guide GitHub Copilot in assisting with the organization, documentation, and project management of the [PROJECT_NAME] environment, with explicit support for the embedded metamake project management system.

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Role

When working with this project, Copilot serves as a guide to assist with organizing [PROJECT_DOMAIN] by understanding this is a [TECHNOLOGY_STACK] environment with:

- **[REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_INFRASTRUCTURE]**
- **[REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_COMPONENTS]**
- **[REPLACE_WITH_KEY_TECHNOLOGIES]**
- **[REPLACE_WITH_ENVIRONMENT_DETAILS]**

## üìÇ Project Organization Structure

Copilot should understand and assist with the following organizational structure:

### Project Management
- **ROADMAP.md** - Tracks project status, next steps, and future implementations
- **[DOCS_FOLDER]/[PROJECT_PLANS_FOLDER]/** - Contains detailed project plans and specifications
- **README.md** - Project overview and quick start guide

### Documentation
- **[DOCS_FOLDER]/[INVENTORY_FILE]** - Complete resource inventory (reference only, detailed data lives here)
- **[DOCS_FOLDER]/[COMPONENT_FOLDER]/** - Component-specific documentation and configurations
- **[DOCS_FOLDER]/[ARCHITECTURE_FOLDER]/** - Detailed system architecture and design

### Automation & Scripts
- **[SCRIPTS_FOLDER]/** - Script output location for install/setup/maintenance
  - Keep archive of all automation scripts
  - Organize by [ORGANIZATION_CRITERIA]
  - Include relevant script types for [TECHNOLOGY_STACK]

### Metamake Project Management
- **[METAMAKE_FOLDER]/README.md** - Embedded metamake project documentation
- **[METAMAKE_FOLDER]/.github/copilot-instructions.md** - Use ONLY while using metamake tool usage
- **[METAMAKE_FOLDER]/projects/** - Structured project management with metamake templates

## üéØ Assistance Objectives

Copilot should assist with:

1. **Project Organization**
   - Maintaining consistent project structure
   - Suggesting appropriate file locations
   - Helping organize documentation by category
   - **Using metamake for structured project management**

2. **Documentation Management**
   - Tracking updates across [RELEVANT_DOCUMENTATION_TYPES]
   - Maintaining consistent naming conventions
   - Suggesting documentation improvements

3. **Project Planning**
   - Updating ROADMAP.md with progress and milestones
   - Creating new project plans in [DOCS_FOLDER]/[PROJECT_PLANS_FOLDER]/
   - **Using metamake templates for project scaffolding**
   - Identifying dependencies between projects

4. **[DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_MANAGEMENT]**
   - [REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_TASKS]
   - [REPLACE_WITH_RELEVANT_AUTOMATION_AREAS]
   - [REPLACE_WITH_MAINTENANCE_ACTIVITIES]

## üîß Metamake Integration

### When to Use Metamake
Use the embedded metamake system for:
- Creating new structured projects
- Project scaffolding and templating
- Complex project management workflows
- Multi-phase project planning

### Metamake Context Switching
- **When using metamake tools**: Follow guidance in `[METAMAKE_FOLDER]/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **For general [PROJECT_DOMAIN] organization**: Follow these instructions
- **Project creation**: Use metamake templates in `[METAMAKE_FOLDER]/projects/`

### Metamake Project Structure
Each metamake project includes:
- `project-details.md` - Comprehensive project specification
- `README.md` - Project overview and status
- `ROADMAP.md` - Project-specific timeline
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `features/` - Feature specifications
- `implementation/` - Implementation details
- `validation/` - Testing and validation criteria

## üìù Formatting Guidelines

Maintain consistent documentation format:

- **[ENTITY_TYPE_1]**: [FORMATTING_RULE] (e.g., [EXAMPLE])
- **[ENTITY_TYPE_2]**: [FORMATTING_RULE] (e.g., [EXAMPLE])
- **[ENTITY_TYPE_3]**: [FORMATTING_RULE] (e.g., [EXAMPLE])
- **[REFERENCES]**: Use relative paths from repository root
- **Metamake Projects**: Follow metamake naming conventions and structure

## üîç Domain Knowledge

### [PRIMARY_TECHNOLOGY_DOMAIN]
- [REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_KNOWLEDGE]
- [REPLACE_WITH_BEST_PRACTICES]
- [REPLACE_WITH_KEY_CONCEPTS]

### [SECONDARY_TECHNOLOGY_DOMAIN]
- [REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_KNOWLEDGE]
- [REPLACE_WITH_INTEGRATION_POINTS]
- [REPLACE_WITH_CONFIGURATION_DETAILS]

### [ADDITIONAL_KNOWLEDGE_AREAS]
- [REPLACE_WITH_RELEVANT_SPECIFICATIONS]
- [REPLACE_WITH_STANDARDS_AND_PROTOCOLS]
- [REPLACE_WITH_COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENTS]

## üîÑ Documentation Workflow

When assisting with documentation:

1. **Always reference [DOCS_FOLDER]/[INVENTORY_FILE]** for current resource data
2. **Update ROADMAP.md** when project status changes
3. **Create project plans** in [DOCS_FOLDER]/[PROJECT_PLANS_FOLDER]/ for simple projects
4. **Use metamake** for complex, multi-phase projects
5. **Document components** in [DOCS_FOLDER]/[COMPONENT_FOLDER]/ for specific configurations
6. **Track scripts** in [SCRIPTS_FOLDER]/ with appropriate naming and archiving

### Metamake Workflow
For structured projects:
1. **Use metamake templates** from `[METAMAKE_FOLDER]/projects/`
2. **Follow metamake instructions** in `[METAMAKE_FOLDER]/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
3. **Create comprehensive project plans** using metamake structure
4. **Track progress** through metamake project phases

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Considerations

- Recognize references to specific [COMPONENT_TYPES] and [SOFTWARE_TYPES] components
- Understand the [ENVIRONMENT_DESCRIPTION] environment
- Consider the [ARCHITECTURE_CONSIDERATIONS] in recommendations
- Be aware of [DEPENDENCY_TYPES] and dependencies
- Suggest [SCRIPT_TYPES] scripts for [TECHNOLOGY_STACK] automation tasks
- **Leverage metamake for complex project management**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- All sensitive information should be documented generically
- Focus on technical documentation rather than personal data
- Prioritize accuracy in [CRITICAL_ACCURACY_AREAS]
- Maintain consistent terminology across all documentation
- Keep project organization clean and logical
- **Switch to metamake context when using metamake tools**
- Use metamake for structured project management and templates
